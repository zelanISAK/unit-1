# Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition

Ms. Sato is a local trader who is interested in the emerging market of cryptocurrencies. She has started to buy and sell electronic currencies, however at the moment she is tracking all his transaction using a ledger in a spreadsheet which is starting to become burdensome and too disorganized. It is also difficult for Ms Sato to find past transactions or important statistics about the currency. Ms Sato is in need of a digital ledger that helps her track the amount of the cryptocurrency, the transactions, along with useful statistics. 

Apart for this requirements, Ms Sato is open to explore a cryptocurrency selected by the developer.

## Proposed Solution

Design statement:
I will to design and make a <ins>digital ledger</ins> for a client who is <ins>Ms. Sato</ins>. The ——– will about ———— and is constructed using the software <ins>Python</ins>. It will take  ———- to make and will be evaluated according to the criteria ———.

Justify the tools/structure of your solution

## Success Criteria
1. The electronic ledger is a text-based software (Runs in the Terminal).
2. The electronic ledger display the basic description of the cyrptocurrency selected.
3. The electronic ledger allows to enter, withdraw and record transactions.
4. The electronic ledger is inclusive; it allows both those with tech and non-tech backgrounds to use it.
5. The electronic ledger records transactions, including the recipient, sender, timestamp, and wallet ID of the involved stakeholders.
6. The electronic ledger validates transactions and identifies any sign of record tampering.
