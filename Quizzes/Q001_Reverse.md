Describe a program that  produces the output shown with the input provided.

Given the input and its respective output, the program accesses every word in a given input string, and prints out the first character, the number of characters between the first and last characters, and the last characters of that word, respectively. 

It's important to note that even when numbers are inputted by the user, these are taken in still as strings, and does what the program's made to do. For example, the input "101" would be taken as a string and the program will output "111" since '1' and '1' are the string's first and last character, and the number of characters in between these two is one.
